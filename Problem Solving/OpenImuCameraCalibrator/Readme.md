# OpenICC: An Open IMU and Camera Calibrator

I developed this repository to experiment with the accurate calibration of action cameras (e.g. GoPro cameras) to use them for geometric vision tasks like Structure-from-Motion, Photogrammetry and SLAM. Modern action cameras are equipped with various sensors like IMUs (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) and GPS. However the calibration data (e.g. camera projection and IMU to camera transformations) is not available.

This is where the OpenImuCameraCalibrator comes in. With this toolbox you can:
* Calibrate the intrinsics of your a GoPro camera. Supported **camera models** are:
  * Fisheye [6]
  * Division Undistortion [5]
  * Field-of-View [3]
  * Double Sphere [2]
  * Extended Unified [4]
  * Pinhole
  * Pinhole with radial-tangential distortion
* Extract the meta data integrated in the MP4 video file (called **telemetry data**)
* Calibrate the **Camera to IMU rotation matrix** and find the dataset dependent **time offset**
* Perform full **continuous time batch optimization** to find the full transformation matrix between IMU and camera
* Do an intrinsic calibration of your IMU using the method described in [11]
* [Experimental] Calibrate the **rolling shutter line delay** (not really working yet)

## Results
This section provides some results for my two GoPro cameras (6 and 9). You can use this to verify your own results or use them as initial values for your application. So far I have been setting them to FullHD with wide FoV and 30/60 fps. This is probably the most common setting that people use.

## Installation instructions

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. and 22.04

1. Clone and build [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) >= 4.5.0 **with** [contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) modules. Latter are needed for Aruco marker detection.
On Ubuntu 22.04 you can also just install it from apt:
``` bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libopencv-contrib-dev
``` 

2. Install [ceres 2.1](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html)
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver
git checkout 2.1.0
mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo make -j install
```

3. Clone and build the [TheiaSfM fork](https://github.com/urbste/pyTheiaSfM).
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/urbste/pyTheiaSfM
cd pyTheiaSfM && git checkout 69c3d37 && mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j
sudo make install
```
4. Build this project
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/urbste/OpenImuCameraCalibrator
mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake ..
make -j
``` 

5. Create a python >3.5 environment (or use your local python - not recommended)
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dockerfile
Build the docker container
``` bash
docker build -t openicc .
```
Now you can mount the OpenICC folder to your docker container, as well as the folder that contains your calibration data (e.g. download [GoPro9 dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjtUX-4ZI0Ydkd2O3BWnaUzfmzm96He4/view?usp=share_link) to /home/Downloads/GoPro9 )
``` bash
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/home -v /home/Downloads/GoPro9:/dataset openicc
``` 
Finally you can run the calibration like this:
``` bash
cd /home
python3 python/run_gopro_calibration.py --path_calib_dataset /dataset/dataset3/ --path_to_build ../OpenImuCameraCalibrator/build/applications/
```

## Working on / ToDo / Contributions Welcome
v0.1
* [x] Code cleanup, add license header
* [x] use different initialization for linear mode
* [x] Use more generic JSON meta data interface, so that others cameras can be calibrated that come with different telemetry formats
* [x] Write example for the calibration of a Smartphone
* [x] Rolling shutter calibration -> first resolve problems with templated spline functions
* [x] Add readout time as a optimizable parameter -> not working well, probably residual weighting needs to be improved
* [x] Allan variance -> imu_utils
* [x] Support AprilTag board from Kalibr to record same datasets
* [x] Calibrate axis misalignment and so on with MutliPoseOptimization from imu_tk
* [x] Include imu axis and scale in spline error functions
* [x] Beautify logs
* [x] Cleanup

v0.2
* [x] Model bias over time with a R3 spline
* [ ] Pose estimation with UPNP or MLPnP to support arbitraty camera types. Right now: undistortion and then using vanilla PnP --> will lead to problems for Ultra Wide Angle fisheye lenses (e.g. GoPro Max or potentially Max lens mod)
* [ ] Pose estimation with RSPnP
* [ ] use only bearings in spline reproj error -> local tangent reprojection error
* [ ] Accurate checkerboard detector (OpenCV has findCheckerboardSB. I integrated a first version but results were weird. Re-check...)
* [ ] Extend to multi-camera systems
* [x] Docker?
* [ ] Add more camera models -> Scaramuzza omni model, ...
* [x] Integrate updated version of spline optimizer

misc
* [ ] Put together a little paper on how this all works
