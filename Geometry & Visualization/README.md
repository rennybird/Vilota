# Script 1 spatialinfo.py: 3D Transformations with Spatialmath and Matplotlib
This script create and visualize 3D transformations using `spatialmath` library

## Usage
Install necessary library which are  `numpy, spatialmath-pythond, and matplotlib`

## Expected Outcome
The Script will open Matplot window and show 3D plot of 5 transformation

Frame A (Black): Rotated using Roll-Pitch-Yaw angles.

Frame B (Red): Translated and then rotated around x, y, and z axes.

Frame C (Green): Similar to Frame B but constructs each transformation step by step.

Frame D (Blue): Combines the transformations of Frame B and Frame C.

Frame E (Cyan): Represents the inverse transformation of Frame C.

# Script 2 visualizecamwireframe.py: Camera Wireframe Animation with Open3D
This script uses open3d to create a simple camera wireframe model and animate it in a 3D space. 

## Usage
Install necessary library which are  'open3d' and 'numpy'

## Expected Outcome
The Open3D visualization window will display showing a camera wireframe model orbiting around a central point in a circular path.
